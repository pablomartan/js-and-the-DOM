# Project from Udacity's Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree
This is the project from the second course in the Nanodegree, using JavaScript
(ES6) to interact with the DOM. It is an interactive landing page, with a
navbar that dinamically adds new content, and takes you to the listed content
when you click on it. It's file structure is as follows:
```
css/
    - style.css
index.html
js/
    - app.js
README.md
```
